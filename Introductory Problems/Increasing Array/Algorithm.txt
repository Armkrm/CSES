first define an array named "a" and a variable named "c" for save all move we need.
then take all inputs step by step. for each inputs, we have two options:
    1- it's bigger or equal to the last one. so we don't need to move.
    2- it's less than the last one. so we need to move. but how much? as much as their difference. so we add this much to "c"
it's all! so at end we output "c".
