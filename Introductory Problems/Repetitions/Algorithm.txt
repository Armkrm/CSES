first we need to make a string variable. then take and store the input string. 
then set two more variable for max block size and current block size. 
after that explore on the string with a for. and check somethings:
    if we are in a block, add one to current block size. (first if)
    if our current block size set a new record and be bigger than max block size, put max block size equal to block size. (secend if)
    if the block changed, reset current block size to one. (third if)
if we do this algorithm at end we check all of the block and return the maximum length of them.
