this one is strange a bit, but we can do it.
first we take n and organize like this:
    if n equal 1, you can see it just can be "1".
    then for other numbers that not equal to 1 and less than 4, can't make wanted arrey.
    then if n equal 4, one of example is "2 4 1 3". so we put it on output.
    else, we use some werid algorithm. as you can see, it's some algorithm to explore all numbers and don't see any unwanted
    number. so in this way we can make one example for that n. but remember that this is just one example. then output the maked
    array.
