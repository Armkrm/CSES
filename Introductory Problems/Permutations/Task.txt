A permutation of integers 1, 2, ..., n is called beautiful if there are no adjacent elements whose difference is 1.
Given n, construct a beautiful permutation if such a permutation exists.

Input
    The only input line contains an integer n.

Output
    Print a beautiful permutation of integers 1, 2, ..., n. If there are several solutions, you may print any of them. 
    If there are no solutions, print "NO SOLUTION".

Constraints
    1 <= n <= 10^6

Example 1
    Input 1:
        5
    Output 1:
        4 2 5 3 1

    Input 2:
        3
    Output 2:
        NO SOLUTION
