The code starts by counting how many times each character appears in the input string using a map. If more than one character
has an odd frequency, the code outputs `NO SOLUTION` because forming a palindrome would be impossible.

If it’s valid, the code constructs the palindrome:
    1. For characters with even counts, half of them are added to the first half of the palindrome.
    2. If there’s a character with an odd count, it’s placed in the center.
    3. The second half of the palindrome is created by reversing the first half and appending it to the result.

This ensures the resulting string is symmetric and satisfies the properties of a palindrome.
