This problem is solved with a number of configurations.

The first case is that one of the numbers is 0 but the other is not 0, we cannot make their pair zero. Because each move 
we make subtracts a value from both. So if it is 0, we cannot make a move on one of them. Of course, if both are 0, they are 
correct from the beginning and there is no need to move at all!

The second case is that the smaller number cannot be less than half the larger number. This is obvious because the maximum 
difference we can make is by adding 2 to one group and 1 to the other at each step. In this case, we have a group of n and
a group of 2n. So it is impossible for the smaller number to be smaller than half the larger number.

The third case is somewhat different. We can subtract 3 for each of the two moves that are symmetrical (i.e. subtract two 
from group a once and one from group b and the next time subtract one from a and two from b). So in this case, if we calculate 
the remaining number in each group to 3, we can see that if it can be made, it must either be both 0 or one 1 and the other 2.

Other cases cannot be made.
This is how it can be easily answered.
