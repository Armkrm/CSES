all point of this task is to generate Gray codes using a simple formula: G(n) = n XOR (n >> 1).  
we use a loop from 0 to 2^n - 1 to calculate each code.  
for every number in the range, we apply the formula to get the Gray code and print its binary form by extracting bits.  
the outer loop handles each number, and the inner loop extracts bits for output in binary format.
